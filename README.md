1. Designed a predictive model with the use of machine learning algorithms to forecast
whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia.


2. Data Preprocessing to improve incomplete, unstructured, inconsistent, redundant,
sprinkled with wacky values. Used EDA to analyze, visualize, investigate, interpret,
discover and summarize data.


3. Used feature encoding technique One code encoding to encode categorical variables
and used Standard Scaler for Feature Scaling.


4. Apply Ensemble Learning Technique with algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM,
Decision Tree and Random Forest to get the best accuracy.


5. Achieve the accuracy more than 80% by all of the algorithms in model evaluation.
